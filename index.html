								<h4>Is God to be worshiped?</h4> 
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%204%3A11&version=KJV">Revelation 4:11</a>:
								Thou art <strong>worthy</strong>, O Lord, to <strong>receive glory and honour and power</strong>: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2099%3A5&version=KJV">Psalm 99:5</a>:
								<strong>Exalt</strong> ye the LORD our God, and <strong>worship</strong> at his footstool; for he is holy.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014%3A11&version=KJV">Romans 14:11</a>:
								For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall <strong>bow</strong> to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012%3A33&version=KJV">Mark 12:33</a>:
								And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is <strong>more</strong> than all <strong>whole burnt offerings and sacrifices</strong>.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Is God alone the object of worship?</h4>
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A3&version=KJV">Exodus 20:3</a>:
								Thou shalt have no other gods <strong>before</strong> me.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2034%3A14&version=KJV">Exodus 34:14</a>:
								For thou shalt <strong>worship no other god</strong>: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A25&version=KJV">Romans 1:25</a>:
								Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and <strong>worshipped and served the creature</strong> more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
					            <br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A8-9&version=KJV">Revelation 22:8-9</a>:
								And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: <strong>worship God</strong>.	
							</p>
							<p>								
								<h4>How is God to be worshiped?</h4>
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012%3A28-29&version=KJV">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>:
								Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God <strong>acceptably</strong> with <strong>reverence</strong> and <strong>godly fear</strong>: For our God is a consuming fire.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%204%3A23-24&version=KJV">Deuteronomy 4:23-24</a>:
								Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Who establishes what is acceptable in God's worship?</h4>
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2012%3A30-32&version=KJV">Deuteronomy 12:30-32</a>:
								Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. <strong>What thing soever I command you, observe to do it</strong>: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Is God to be worshiped by the devices and imaginations of men?</h4>
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A4-6&version=KJV">Exodus 20:4-6</a>:
								Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A20-23&version=KJV">Colossians 2:20-23</a>:
								Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, (Touch not; taste not; handle not; Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Is ignorant worship considered true and acceptable worship to God?</h4>
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204%3A22-23&version=KJV">John 4:22-23</a>:
								Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Is vain worship considered acceptable to God?</h4> 
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2014%3A15-18&version=KJV">Acts 14:15-18</a>:
								We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207%3A6-8&version=KJV">Mark 7:6-8</a>:
								This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Is respecting holy days acceptable worship?</h4> 
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galations%204%3A9-11&version=KJV">Galatians 4:9-11</a>:
								But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A16-17&version=KJV">Colossians 2:16-17</a>:
								Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015%3A7-9&version=KJV">Matthew 15:7-9</a>:
								Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.								
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Is respecting the Lord's Day acceptable worship?</h4>
								<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A1-3&version=KJV">Gensis 2:1-3</a>:
								Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and <strong>he rested on the seventh day</strong> from all his work which he had made. God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. 
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A8-11&version=KJV">Exodus 20:8-11</a>:
								Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and <strong>rested the seventh day</strong>: wherefore <strong>the LORD blessed the sabbath day</strong>, and hallowed it.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%205%3A15&version=KJV">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>:
								And remember that thou wast a <strong>servant</strong> in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God <strong>brought thee out thence</strong> through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to <strong>keep the sabbath day</strong>.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202%3A27-28&version=KJV">Mark 2:27-28</a>:
								And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is <strong>Lord also of the sabbath</strong>.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A8-11&version=KJV">Hebrews 4:8-11</a>:
								For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. <strong>There remaineth therefore a rest</strong> to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. <strong>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest</strong>, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A18&version=KJV">Matthew 5:18</a>:
								For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise <strong>pass from the law, till all be fulfilled</strong>.
								<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020%3A7&version=KJV">Acts 20:7</a>:
								And upon the <strong>first day of the week</strong>, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
