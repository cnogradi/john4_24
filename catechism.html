</p>
<p>
	<h4>Is God alone the object of worship?</h4>
	<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A3&version=KJV">Exodus 20:3</a>:
	Thou shalt have no other gods <strong>before</strong> me.
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2034%3A14&version=KJV">Exodus 34:14</a>:
	For thou shalt <strong>worship no other god</strong>: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A25&version=KJV">Romans 1:25</a>:
	Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and <strong>worshipped and served the creature</strong> more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

	And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.

	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God <strong>acceptably</strong> with <strong>reverence</strong> and <strong>godly fear</strong>: For our God is a <strong>consuming fire</strong>.
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%204%3A23-24&version=KJV">Deuteronomy 4:23-24</a>:
	Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. For the LORD thy God is a <strong>consuming fire</strong>, even a jealous God.
</p>
<p>

	<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2012%3A30-32&version=KJV">Deuteronomy 12:30-32</a>:
	Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. <strong>What thing soever I command you, observe to do it</strong>: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
</p>
<p>

	Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven <strong>image</strong>, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A20-23&version=KJV">Colossians 2:20-23</a>:
	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, (Touch not; taste not; handle not; Which all are to perish with the using;) after the <strong>commandments and doctrines of men</strong>? Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in <strong>will worship</strong>, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.

<p>
	<h4>Is vain worship considered acceptable to God?</h4>
	<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2014%3A15-18&version=KJV">Acts 14:15-18</a>:
	We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these <strong>vanities</strong> unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207%3A6-8&version=KJV">Mark 7:6-8</a>:
	This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Howbeit in <strong>vain</strong> do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men
</p>
<p>
	<h4>Is God to be publicly worshiped by men?</h4>
	<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A18-21&version=KJV">Romans 1:18-21</a>:
	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they <strong>glorified</strong> him not as God
</p>

	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the <strong>weak and beggarly</strong> elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A16-17&version=KJV">Colossians 2:16-17</a>:
	Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a <strong>shadow</strong> of things to come; but the <strong>body</strong> is of Christ.
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015%3A7-9&version=KJV">Matthew 15:7-9</a>:
	Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the <strong>commandments of men</strong>.

	And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had <strong>healed on the sabbath day</strong>, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond <strong>on the sabbath day</strong>? And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit <strong>whole on the sabbath day</strong>? Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202%3A22&version=KJV">1 Peter 2:22</a>:
	Who <strong>did no sin</strong>, neither was guile found in his mouth
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205%3A21&version=KJV">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>:

	<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A1-5&version=KJV">Luke 6:1-5</a>:
	And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? And Jesus <strong>answering</strong> them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? And he said unto them, That <strong>the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath</strong>.

	And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. And Jesus <strong>answering</strong> spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? And <strong>they could not answer him again to these things</strong>.

	And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and <strong>taught</strong>: and there was a man whose right hand was withered. And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?
</p>
<p>
	<h4>Did Jesus Christ command his disciples to teach to do all things he had commanded them?</h4>

For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
	<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A23-26&version=KJV">John 14:23-26</a>:
	Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will <strong>keep my words</strong>: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, <strong>whatsoever I have said unto you</strong>.

	For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. <strong>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God</strong>.
